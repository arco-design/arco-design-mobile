# Internationalization

All component copywriting is in Chinese by default, and other languages can be used through settings.

=====================


Internationalization is achieved through the [ContextProvider](#/components/context-provider) component.

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import { ContextProvider } from '@arco-design/mobile-react';
import enUS from '@arco-design/mobile-utils/esm/locale/en-US';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ContextProvider locale={enUS}>
    <YourApp />
  </ContextProvider>,
  CONTAINER
);
```

## Supported languages

Simplified Chinese/English
